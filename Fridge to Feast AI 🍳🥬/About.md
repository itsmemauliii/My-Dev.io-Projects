# About This Project 💭✨

Hey, I’m Mauli -> A data science student who’s always been curious about how AI can go beyond analytics and actually *do* stuff. When I saw the [Google AI Studio Build Track](https://dev.to/deved/build-apps-with-google-ai-studio), I knew this was my signal to try something outside the usual Python notebook grind.

## 🧠 Why I Participated

Honestly? I wanted to break out of tutorial hell.  
I’ve spent so much time *watching* others build cool things with AI that I forgot how much fun it is to *actually* create. This challenge gave me a space to:
- Explore **Gemini Pro's vision + reasoning power**
- Play around with **Imagen API's image generation**
- Build a real, working app inside one single tool (AI Studio), no boilerplate, no deployment stress

It felt like being back in school but the fun part of school where you stay up late making something cool just because you can.

## 🥗 Why a Fridge Recipe App?

We all open the fridge, stare into the void, and think: “What the heck can I cook with *this*?”  
I figured that’s a universal problem AI could solve, something real, simple, and instantly helpful. Also, let’s be honest: using AI to turn leftover veggies into gourmet meals is *peak 2025 vibes*.

## 💫 Takeaways

This wasn’t just about building an app. It was a reminder that:
- You don’t need to know *everything* to get started.
- Creativity is just structured chaos + the right prompts.
- AI tools today can turn a random idea into a working app, fast.

I walked away from this project feeling more confident in my skills, excited about what’s possible, and hyped to keep building.
