# 📊 Guess The Graph –> A Gamified Way to Learn Data Visualization

Welcome to **Guess The Graph**, a fun and interactive game that helps beginners learn **which type of graph** fits a given data scenario, line chart, bar chart, pie chart, and more through fast-paced, quiz-style gameplay.

🎯 Built for the [World’s Largest Hackathon – Beyond the Code Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/wlh)

## 🧠 What It Does

You’re shown a short real-world scenario like:

> _“You want to show sales growth over 6 months”_

You then choose from 3-4 graph types:
- 📈 Line Chart
- 📊 Bar Chart
- 🥧 Pie Chart
- 🔘 Scatter Plot

If you guess the right one → ✅  
If not → ❌ you learn why.

Rinse. Repeat. Score. Learn.

## 💡 Why I Built This

Let’s be real, most people don’t know **when to use what chart**. Tutorials are boring. Definitions are forgettable.

So I turned it into a game. A simple challenge-based way to build your **data viz intuition**, without textbooks or slides.

Perfect for:
- 📚 Students
- 🧪 Bootcamp learners
- 💼 Data newbies
